# livetweet
An Android application for livetweeting conferences and other events.

## The Backstory
I was sitting by my wife at a conference we both attended almost a year ago now, and I watched her live tweeting her thoughts about the talks. 
She had a very prescriptive method for doign this that involved a lot of copy/pasting and manual linking of tweets.
I figured I could make this workflow a little more streamlined, so I built her an app. We've been quietly beta-ing it for quite a while now, and it's finally ready to go public, I think.
Please feel free to file issues in the tracker if you find bugs or have suggestions! PRs with changes are welcome as well (although if you have a big change, please reach out first so we can talk about it).
